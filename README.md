# IoT_Healthcare_Security
This addresses security challenges in IoT healthcare systems by using preprocessing to prevent overfitting, enhancing explainability with SHAP, and employing ensemble learning to boost accuracy. Using the IoT Flock Tool dataset, we develop a robust intrusion detection framework, improving transparency, accuracy, and adaptability.
The dataset, generated using the IoT Flock Tool, serves as the foundation for training and testing the models. Since the primary goal is binary classification—to predict whether an attack is present (True) or not (False)—the selected models include K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Logistic Regression (LR), and Random Forest (RF). These models were chosen for their simplicity, efficiency, and proven effectiveness in classification tasks. 
The dataset, although pre-cleaned, required additional preprocessing to ensure optimal model performance. This involved removing irrelevant columns and reducing the number of normal traffic samples to balance the dataset. By addressing imbalances, the models were better equipped to avoid bias towards the majority class, a critical step for accurate intrusion detection in real-world scenarios. Feature engineering further enhanced the dataset by identifying and selecting the most impactful features while transforming raw data into meaningful representations. 
Once the dataset was prepared, the models were implemented and rigorously optimized. Grid search was employed to identify the best hyper-parameters for each model, ensuring peak performance. To enhance prediction reliability, ensemble learning techniques were incorporated. This involved combining the predictions of individual models (KNN, LR, and RF) using a majority voting mechanism. The ensemble approach reduced inconsistencies in predictions and improved overall model accuracy and robustness. 
The final workflow stage emphasized explainability, bridging the gap between model performance and user trust. SHAP (SHapley Additive Explanations) was employed to provide insights into feature importance, offering a transparent understanding of which features most influenced the models' decisions. SHAP visualizations made it easier to interpret predictions and build trust among stakeholders, such as network administrators and healthcare providers. This workflow ensured a balance between performance, interpretability, and computational efficiency, making the models suitable for deployment in IoT healthcare environments.
